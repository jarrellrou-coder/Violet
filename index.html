Hi, there! My name is Violet, and I'm a black domestic shorthair living in Maryland. I was born in Brooklyn, New York in May of 2023. Yes, I'm a gemini.
</p>
<p>
My mom adopted me on August 13th of 2023, when I was about three months old. My name was "Catmint" then, and I was still living at the ACC Shelter (go Boroughbreds!) with my sisters Rosemary and Thyme.</p>
<p>
I was asleep when my mom first came into the shelter, and she looked at allll the other adult cats there who needed a home, but none of them were able or wanted to go home with her.</p>
<p>
When I woke up, there she was! I knew she was my mom, even if she didn't. I marched over to the front of the cage to yell at her and let her know she was meant to be my mom. Hey, lady! It's me!</p>
<p>
As soon as she held me, I snuggled into her neck. No way was I letting her go now that I'd found her! She took me home in a big cardboard carrier a few minutes later. We've been best friends ever since!</p>
