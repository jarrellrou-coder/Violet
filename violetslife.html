I'll be honest, my life rules. </p>
<p> My Mornings: On weekdays, my mom and I wake up pretty early and snuggle. I watch her do her makeup and get ready for work, and then I get breakfast. I eat a little bit and then head straight back to bed.
</p>
<p>
My Afternoons: In the afternoon, I usually sleep, no matter who's home. It takes a lot of beauty rest to stay this cute! </p>
<p>
 My Evenings: Mom usually comes home around 5:30, and I'm always waiting on the stairs for her. Then she tells me about her day (boring) and I tell her about mine (very exciting) and we look at her phone. When the sun sets, I get the zoomies! I'm a creature of the night. We play and play and snuggle, and then go to sleep so we can do it all again the next day. </p>
