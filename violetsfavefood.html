Personally, I think I should be hired by CatFancy as a food critic. Here are my must haves: </p>
<p>
1. I cannot get enough of croissants, and will climb all over anyone who's eating one. When I'm very good (read: very cute) Mom will give me the little flakes from the bottom of the pastry bag. She calls them my "fish food."</p>
<p>
2. As you can tell, I love bread! If you've got a sandwich with some soft white bread, or even a tortilla, you've got a friend in me.
<p>
3. I also have a refined palate...I'm not a fan of soft, fresh cheeses but a tangy sprinkling of Parmesan makes me go bananas! Ciao Bella!
<p>
 4. All of the treats above are delicious, but one of my greatest pleasures is crime. Any chance I get I will steal my roommate, Penny's food from her bowl! I have to make sure she isn't around though; she doesn't like me much. I wonder if it has to do with my stealing her food?
