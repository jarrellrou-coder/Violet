Here are a few of my favorite toys! I'm very discerning, and love playtime.</p>
<p>
1. My absolute favorite toy is my wand toy! The little toys on the end change sometimes. Once they get worn out, Mom attaches a new one. I've had two bees and a fish so far! I love chasing this toy around the house, and will drag it everywhere with me.</p>
<p>
2. The first toy I ever owned is my second favorite: a pipe cleaner with a little pink feather attached. They sent me home with that one from the shelter, and I still love it. </p>
<p>
3. My third-favorite toy is my sparkle ball! It's a litte pink pompom with pink sparkles on it. I love to chase it, especially under doors so my mom has to go pick them up. </p>
<p>
 4. Last but not least, I love my little plastic springs! I love the way they bounce, click, and clatter on the floor. I chase those under doors and furniture too :) </p>
